# CodingTaskForXn
Brief coding task sent to me by a recruiter, consisting of the following three tasks:

“Please write some object-oriented code in C#.NET. The code should be made as reusable as possible. 

- It should tell me how many letters are in the following sentence ‘Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Eanean sodales justo et Enim ornare, a congue lacus commodo.’ 

- How many number 1s are in the following number 17272838119191929838299111 

- And the result of 7 + 5.”

Not wanting to be one of *those* guys who do everything exactly to spec, I skipped all the hard coding and instead made this, which while capable of the above lets you input your own values, because who wants to sit there copy-pasting stuff from a notepad somewhere when you could just mash your keyboard a bit and see what pops up?

Anyway, the .cs file here was intended as a quick console application to complete the above. For the most part I avoided reinventing the wheel, because while I could sit here for three hours and give you a thousand line file with a rudimentary manual equation evaluator just to show off I know what a for-loop is, I think we all have better things to do with our lives. And hey, I actually ended up learning something doing it this way, as I previously had no idea .NET DataTables had an inbuilt string mathematical expression evaluator.
